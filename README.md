# Comparing-Simulated-and-Synthetic-Data-Types-COVID


## Description

This contains R code for creating a simulation trial of COVID-19 vaccine data and corresponding synthetic datasets including analysis and graphs. 


Simulated clinical trial data was generated for three different types for trials (randomized control trial, observational study, and external data) based on probabilities from COVID-19 data. Data comes from February-August 2021 in the United Kingdom. The outcome being looked at is testing positive for COVID-19, and the treatment/exposure variable of interest is the BNT162b2 Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Ethnicity and sex are included as potential confounders in the RCT and observational study.  References for original datasets can be found below.

Synthetic data was generated using the R library Synthpop. Synthetic data is created by subsetting the original data to include only variables of interest, and then creating a cookbook of values.  Three methods of synthetic data generation were used, each corresponding to its own R script: CART (Categorical and Regression Tree modelling), random sampling, and linear/logistic regression. More information on how Synthpop generates synthetic data can be found here:
https://www.synthpop.org.uk/about-synthpop.html#methodology

The simulated and synthetic data are compared between data types and sample sizes by measuring the change in response rate.  The standard mean difference was also calulcated and graphed.

Three methods are used for data synthesis and compared as a secondary analysis: CART, linear/logistic regression, and random sampling.

## Installation

The script can be downloaded and run in R Studio.

## Usage

This code is for comparing the quality of synthetic controls between different data types.  The simulated probabilties can be altered to fit new datasets for further testing.
